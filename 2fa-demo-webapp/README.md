Two-Factor Authentication Demo Webapp
=============================================================================

Now this is only a demo and I want it to be easily deployable with no fuss.
In a real application you should of course take more security measures than
I did in this demo. Including but not limited to

* Ensure that logins only happens over an encrypted line
* Ensure that the session cookie is only sent over an encrypted line
* Perhaps encrypt the value of the google authenticator shared secret in the database
